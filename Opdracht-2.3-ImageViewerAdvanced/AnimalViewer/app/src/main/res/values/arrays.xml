<item>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest
   living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its species name refers to its camel-like
   shape and its leopardlike colouring. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely
   long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns.</item>

<item>Frogs are a diverse and largely carnivorous group of shortbodied, tailless amphibians
   composing the order Anura (Ancient Greek an-, without + oura, tail). The oldest fossil
   "proto-frog" appeared in the early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests
   their origins may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago.</item>

<item>Monkeys are haplorhine ("dry-nosed") primates, a paraphyletic group generally possessing tails
   and consisting of approximately 260 known living species. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling
   (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most
   species are also active during the day (diurnal).
